# Why LISP? #

Data mining  is not about the algorithms, it is about the data. We use tools like Ourmine to build microscopes to look at data. Therefore, I'm a great fan of scripting, of getting a prototype up and running as fast as possible in order to gather insights from the domain. But which scripting language? Well, for tiny tasks, Awk and Bash are great. But for more complex tasks requiring intricate data structures, you need something with a little more structure.

So let's play the language selection game. Let's pick a language that runs fast, has mature tools, lots of tutorial material out there on the web, good textbooks, and has a fighting chance of being around in time to come (think of your favorite language: Ruby, Lua, Clojure, etc.  How old is it? When did it get popular? When will it fade away?).

After filtering languages on the above criteria, I came down to LISP.   It runs fast. It has a ton of one-line material. But most of all, it has it has longevity and staying power.
