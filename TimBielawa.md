<h1>Introduction</h1>

I’ve contributed some patches to Ubuntu. Mostly small stuff, fixing a typo in a command, adding LSB required options to init scripts. Made a couple bug fixes here and there too on launchpad.<br>
<br>
Submitted a patch to the Red Hat Func and Certmaster projects to make their init script Debian/Ubuntu compatable once.<br>
<br>
I like well formatted data (XML). DocBook turns me on :-)<br>
<br>
I like version control and think every new CS student should be forced to learn proper source control management. Check out my branches on GitHub.<br>
<br>
I love calculus.<br>
<br>
I’m just a passionate learner trying to get through CS alive. I’ve been fortunate to have a hand full of amazing professors along the way who care.<br>
<br>
I’m a member of the WVU ACM and a founding member (current president) of the WVU Free Software Group. I’ve been President of the WVU IEEE chapter once before. I’m a member of the WVU Computer Science Department Student Advisory Council and a member of the College of Engineering’s Student Advisory Council. I’m currently a senior sys. admin for the CS department.<br>
