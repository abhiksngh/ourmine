Experimental methods in data mining 10%

Implement more functions:
  * One more pre-processor and FSS and discretization method (and you can repeat functions taken by other groups)
  * One more clusterer and  classifer NOT implemented by other groups.
  * Record you selected implementation at [the usual place](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqtLfKAJzgNrdEs0UnBXQm5WcWlIRDNMWWFiZWtNR2c&hl=en).

Run different combinations of pre-processor`*`discretizers`*`clusters`*`FSS`*`classifiers through at least 10 data sets (ranging easy to hard according to [the method I described before](http://code.google.com/p/ourmine/wiki/Cs473proj2#How_to_Pick_Test_Data).

Run the results through the winLossTie script you've seen in class.

Commit all changes on-line (as per usual) and  also
  * Commit winLossTie results for all data (in one table)
  * Commit winLossTie results for all datasets   individually.
